I"‘<p>While Iâ€™m a frequent user of Processing, I mostly use it for generating data visualizations. As a result, Iâ€™m generally using a very limited subset of its capabilities. From time to time I like to explore the documentation for cool features that I havenâ€™t had the opportunity to use. Recently, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">noise()</code> function caught my eye.</p>
