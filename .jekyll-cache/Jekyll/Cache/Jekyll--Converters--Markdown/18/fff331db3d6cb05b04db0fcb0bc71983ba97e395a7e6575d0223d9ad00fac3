I"~<p>While I’m a frequent user of Processing, I mostly use it for generating data visualizations. As a result, I’m generally using a very limited subset of its capabilities. From time to time I like to explore the documentation for cool features that I haven’t had the opportunity to use. Recently, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">noise()</code> function caught my eye.</p>
