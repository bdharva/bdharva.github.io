I"À<p>When you live in an apartment, the elation that comes with the purchase of your very first kayaks is quickly replaced with that â€œoh shit where are we going to keep these?!â€ feeling. In my case, the feeling struck the night before we were going to be hosting a party and less than an hour before Home Depotâ€™s closing time. With that in mind, I armed myself with a rough design and even rougher shopping list, and I headed out the door.</p>
