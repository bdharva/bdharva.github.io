I"<p>As part of our “Build-a-Brand” project during my training program at Anheuser-Busch, we were tasked with creating branded packaging and promotional items for the launch event. Bottle openers were a natural choice for the event and something I’d been wanting to design for a while. Aside from being aesthetically attractive, I wanted to create an opener that wouldn’t crimp the bottle caps. From an experiental perspective, there’s something very satisfying about the caps just “popping” off.</p>
