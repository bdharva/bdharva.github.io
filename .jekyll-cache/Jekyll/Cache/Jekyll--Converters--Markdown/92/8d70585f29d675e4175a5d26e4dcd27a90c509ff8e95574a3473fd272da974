I"ø<p>As a lifelong athlete, Iâ€™ve suffered my fair share of concussions. Most were pretty obvious to me and everyone around me. But my last concussion in college was different. It was just a typical wrestling practice. The room was hot, we were drilling hard, and, although I was starting to feel dizzy and nauseous, I just figured I was dehydrated. As the end of practice neared and I started struggling to get back up off the mat or string sentences together, I finally too late what was happening.</p>
