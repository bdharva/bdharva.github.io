I"â<p>My friends at Rex Animal Health were looking to launch a sexy new website ahead of their participation in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/event-info/disrupt-sf-2016/">TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Battlefield</a>. In our time together at the <a href="http://sprintaccel.com/">Sprint Accelerator</a> in Kansas City, theyâ€™d gotten a good feel for my design style and visual aesthetic, so they entrusted me with designing their new site. The process, as I lay out below, was fairly straightforward. I started with a few rounds of interviews and feedback sessions to scope the project and understand the intent of the new site. Using this information I put together some wireframes and simple mockups in a handful of visual styles.</p>
