I"%<p>I’ve started and stopped this note many times over the past few years, and, by now, I’m sure you must’ve been expecting it. As Jolt has gone through various rough patches, the time to wind down has seemed near. However, each time, the thought of admitting failure was enough to motivate a renewed vigor to right the ship, and I continued in hopes of soon having better news to share. In retrospect, I could have and should have been more able to admit the failures as they came and to proactively ask for help. That tendency to double down in isolation when things got hard has been my greatest failure along the way. With so many people placing their faith and support with us, I heaped far too much pressure on myself not to disappoint and, in effect, I hid whenever failure felt imminent.</p>
