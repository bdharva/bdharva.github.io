I"<p>I’ve participated in NCAA March Madness bracket pools since I was in fifth grade, with decent success over the years. However, I’ve recently found it more difficult and tedious to pick “good” brackets, as my free time (and level of interest) for keeping up with the wide world of sports has waned. However, I still enjoy the annual tradition that brings family and friends together, and the games just aren’t nearly as fun to watch without a reason to care about who wins (since Penn State generally isn’t in any of them).</p>
