I"<p>As some of my friends may know, I’m a bit of a podcast fiend and a data nut. So, naturally, one of my favorite podcasts is FiveThirtyEight’s “What’s the Point”. <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-data-and-fivethirtyeight-want-you-to-visualize-your-podcast-habits/">This week’s episode</a> dug into the <a href="http://www.dear-data.com/by-week/">Dear Data project</a> in which a pair of data visualization professionals exhanged weekly postcards with hand-drawn data renderings for a year. Much of their work centered around the activities of daily life, from laughter to indecision. Near the end of the episode, they challenged listeners to track a week’s worth of their own podcast listening habits, visualize them on a postcard, and send them in.</p>
