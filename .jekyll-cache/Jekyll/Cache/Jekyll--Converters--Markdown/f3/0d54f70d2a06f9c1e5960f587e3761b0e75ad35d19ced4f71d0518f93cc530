I"~#<p>After having Google Timeline tracking enabled on my phone on and off over the last seven or so years, I became curious if the data was available for export and what it might show. After finding a way to download it, I slammed together a quick and dirty tool for mapping it with Processing and the Unfolding maps library. The early results were cool enough for a few friends to ask me to share the tool with them, so I shoe-horned everything into a work-in-progress GUI from a previous project and called the janky result “good enough for now”. Below are a few different views of my own data, followed by documentation for the tool. The documentation, along with the source code, can be found <a href="https://github.com/bdharva/google_timeline_maps">here</a> if you’d like to play with your own data.</p>

<p><em>Mapping Google Timeline data with Processing 2 &amp; the Unfolding library</em></p>

<p>While this started out as a very hacky personal project to map my own data, once I shared <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bsl9pEoH_rf/">some of my visualizations</a> I started getting requests from friends wanting to make their own. While it’s still hacky, this is a rough first pass at streamlining my workflow for more general use. I’ve listed a few ideas for future development at the bottom of this page. Feel free to use <a href="https://github.com/bdharva/google_timeline_maps/issues">https://github.com/bdharva/google_timeline_maps/issues</a> to suggest additional updates and flag any bugs you encounter.</p>

<h3 id="application-setup">Application Setup</h3>

<p><em>Note: These directions are for Mac OS X users. If you’re using Windows or Linux, you’ll be following a similar process, but will need to reference OS-specific directions at each of the websites indicated below and for Terminal-based steps.</em></p>

<h4 id="install-processing-2">Install Processing 2</h4>

<p>To utilize the Unfolding maps library, you’ll need to be running Processing 2 (not 3). If you don’t already have it installed, go to <a href="https://processing.org/download/">https://processing.org/download/</a> and scroll down to “Stable Releases”. Click the OS-appropriate download link for version 2.2.1. Unzip the archive and move the extracted “Processing” application to your “Applications” folder.</p>

<h4 id="install-unfolding-library">Install Unfolding library</h4>

<p>Go to <a href="http://unfoldingmaps.org/">http://unfoldingmaps.org/</a> and click the “For Processing 2” button under “Download”. Unzip the archive and put the extracted “Unfolding” folder into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">libraries</code> folder of your Processing directory. By default, the Processing directory will be at <code class="highlighter-rouge">User/Documents/Processing</code>. If this is your first library, you’ll need to create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">libraries</code> directory within it.</p>

<h4 id="install-python">Install Python</h4>

<p>If you don’t already have Python installed on your machine (you can check with <code class="highlighter-rouge">python -V</code> in Terminal), follow the documentation <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download">here</a> to select and install the correct version. The parts of this process that utilize Python should work just fine whether you’re running version 2.x or 3.x.</p>

<h4 id="clone-project-repository">Clone project repository</h4>

<p>In Terminal, navigate to your Processing directory and execute <code class="highlighter-rouge">git clone https://github.com/bdharva/google_timeline_maps.git</code> to create a local clone of the repository.</p>

<h3 id="preparing-data">Preparing Data</h3>

<h4 id="download-google-timeline-data">Download Google Timeline data</h4>

<p>Access your Google Takeout at <a href="https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout">https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout</a>. De-select everything except “Location History”. Be sure that the “JSON format” option is selected. Follow the remaining steps to create and download your archive. Once downloaded, unzip the archive and move the extracted <code class="highlighter-rouge">Location History.json</code> file to the sketch directory <code class="highlighter-rouge">.../google_timeline_maps/data/google</code>.</p>

<h4 id="filter-and-transform-data">Filter and transform data</h4>

<p>In Terminal, navigate to the same directory where you’ve just saved your location history file. If you want to map the full unfiltered dataset, simply execute <code class="highlighter-rouge">python parse.py</code>. If you’d like to filter the data to a given date range, execute <code class="highlighter-rouge">python parse.py [start_date] [end_date]</code>, with the dates formatted as <code class="highlighter-rouge">YYYY-MM-DD</code>. The Python script is just converting the .json file to .csv, re-formatting coordinates, and stripping away extraneous data not necessary for mapping.</p>

<h3 id="mapping-your-data">Mapping Your Data</h3>

<h4 id="launch-the-sketch">Launch the sketch</h4>

<p>Open the <code class="highlighter-rouge">google_timeline_maps.pde</code> sketch in Processing 2 and launch the sketch with <code class="highlighter-rouge">cmd + r</code> or by pressing the play icon in the user interface. Depending on the size of the timeline dataset you’re loading, it might take a little while for the interface to load once you run the sketch.</p>

<h4 id="theory-of-operation">Theory of operation</h4>

<p>When the sketch finishes launching, you’ll start out on the “views” interface. Views can be defined with latitude and longitude, zoom level, the title you’d like to display on exports, and the preferred file name for those exports. The guides at the bottom of the page will help you to configure some views and change interfaces.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/work/google_timeline_maps/views.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Short of developing a longer list of presets or a more robust inerface (not working on either at the moment), I recommend that you start by Googling city coordinates and then fiddling around in the map/plot view to fine tune things – more on that in a second.</p>

<p>Pressing <code class="highlighter-rouge">S</code> will switch into the settings menu, where you can configure how you’d like your views to be rendered when mapping and plotting data. The annotated screenshot below lays out how these settings correspond with the output.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/work/google_timeline_maps/settings.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>From the views interface, you can toggle to a map of the view with <code class="highlighter-rouge">M</code>. Here you can pan and zoom to get the view right, and the underlying settings for the view will be automatically updated and saved. Pressing <code class="highlighter-rouge">P</code> will toggle on and off a plotted view of the data overlaid on the map.</p>

<p>Every time you plot the data, the view will be saved under the specified file name. Note that if the guides are displayed while plotting, they will be included in the export. I tend to leave them on while fine-tuning the view, and then hide them when I’m ready to plot my final export. It’s also worth noting that, for now, the map cannot be panned or zoomed while data is plotted.</p>

<p>Exports will be saved in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/exports</code> nested within the directory that you’re running the sketch from. All files will be prefixed with the date, so multiple plots of a given view on a given day will overwrite one another unless you change the specified file name for the view.</p>
