Here be some words
=================
This project is my first pass at building a website using Jekyll. Additionally, it's my first time using GitHub, so that's cool. I'm sure I'm doing a lot of this in non-standard and frowned upon ways, but for now I'm going to focus more on hacking shit together in a way that works, and worry about pretty semantic code later. 

If anything more significant arises from the project than the aforementioned details, I'll put more words here. Cheers!
