If there's one thing that college taught me, it's how to procrastinate. There was no end to readily available diversions living in a fraternity house with forty other guys equally eager to avoid their piles of coursework. In what soon became a weekly routine, most of my work would sit untouched until less than 24 hours before it was due. I cannot count the number of nights I spent burning the midnight oil, completing work within only a few hours of my deadline (often while the sun rose over the Charles). With most of my classes later in the day, leaving enough time for early morning naps, and a natural propensity for staying up far too late at night, work or no, it was a natural habit to fall into.

But there was something more to it. The closer a deadline loomed, the more productive I always seemed to be. As I became increasingly comfortable with the pressure and sense of urgency that the compressed time scale necessitated, my procrastination became increasingly efficient. What had started as mere short-sighted avoidance of work developed into a finely-tuned sense for the minimum amount of time needed to complete a task. It was still procrastnation, but I considered it procrastination at its finest. By waiting until the pressure was on and then embracing it, I maximized by productivity, minimized my time input, and maintained (or, in some cases, improved) my results.

More words here. Or new ones? Include cutting weight in high school for wrestling?...
