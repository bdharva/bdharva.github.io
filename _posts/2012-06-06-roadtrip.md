I'm happy to say that, following the most amazing two weeks of my life, I am safely back in Boston (in one piece). In my fraternity it's somewhat of a tradition to take a pledge class roadtrip between the end of classes and commencement (MIT has a roughly 2.5 week gap). Most years an RV or a large passenger van is rented for a week-long trek between the houses of the graduating brothers living on the east coast (ie. reasonable driving ditance from Boston). My class landed on a loftier goal -- we resolved to visit every single pledge brother's house on the trip.

Unfortunately, we immediately found that the houses of our brothers from Jordan and Palestine were going to be tough drives and reluctantly eliminated them from the list. Additionally, one of the brothers who had taken a leave of absence from school to pursue the start-up life was unable to join us, leaving us seven mandatory stops to fit in. Adding in a nicely placed stop at an underclassman's lake house, the obligatory debauchery of Las Vegas, and a west coast terminus, and we had our list:

+ Cambridge, MA
+ West Roxbury, MA
+ Greenfield, NH
+ New York, NY
+ Sykesville, MD
+ Watauga Lake, TN
+ Tulsa, OK
+ Austin, TX
+ Tucson, AZ
+ Las Vegas, NV
+ Palo Alto, CA
+ San Francisco, CA

Twenty states in thirteen days. An aggressive itinerary to keep, especially if we wanted to catch our flight from San Francisco back to Boston for graduation. What follows is only a small snapshot of what ensued. I'm not sure how to even begin to describe the trip. Surreal. Unforgettable. Out of control. America is a big ass place and we did our best to see as much of it as possible in that short span, by way of local watering holes, local tourist traps, and local law enforcement.
