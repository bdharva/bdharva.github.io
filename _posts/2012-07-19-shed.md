Needing more space in our garage for actually parking vehicles, my family determined that it was necessary to build a secondary storage space to house lawn mowers, bicycles, and all of the other clutter from our garage. I was lucky enough to have parents that were trusting (and supportive) enough to allow me to design the structure and oversee its construction. The entire process was incredibly rewarding, as I got to go through design iterations, permiting, surveying, budgeting, and all of the various aspects of actual construction. And the completion of the project would not have been possible without all of the helping hands that friends and family lent throughout the process.

It's worth pointing out that the key design feature, the inverted roof, is more than simply aesthetic (and presented a significant engineering challenge). Although it fits nicely into some traditions of vernacular Appalachian architecture, its primary purpose is to catch rainwater, which it deposits into collection barrels located adjacent to the shed. Thanks to its siting at the highpoint of our property, these barrels enable gravity-fed watering of downhill vegetable gardens and flower beds.
