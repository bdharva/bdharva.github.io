I've now seen quite a few interesting posts on Hacker News in the last few months by folks sharing their solutions for dealing with the deluge of emails that many of us trudge through on a daily basis. And I've watched with mild amusement as each has touched on a few points of similarity with my own approach, before veering off the mark. One common issue that I've seen with these various approaches is their use of the Gmail custom star types and priority inbox features that, although useful, are not at all compatible with [Mailbox](http://www.mailboxapp.com/) (and yet they all seem to use it -- a testament to just how kickass Mailbox is for quickly and easily maintaining inbox zero).

Given that Mailbox plays an integral role in how I approach email, it's critical that my workflow in Gmail be accomodating of it. And it is. So I just don't bother with the stars or priority inbox. I do most of my initial email processing (sorting, deleting, archiving, etc.) via the Mailbox app on my iPhone. For the sake of my productivity, I only check it a few times per day -- after breakfast, after lunch, and when I'm finishing up my day's work sometime in the evening. Through a rigorous and structured approach, I'm normally back to an empty inbox within a minute or two, despite the volume of email that I have to process.

In this processing phase, I generally only sort the mail, save for the very brief responses. And this is where Mailbox is clutch. With simple side swipes, I can delete or archive inconsequential mail, and delegate the remaining mail to one of my five task-oriented folders: action, awaiting reply, delegated, reference, and procrastinated. At this point, I pivot to my laptop, to work out the remaining process in Gmail. It normally looks something like this:

Using Gmail's multiple inbox feature, I've effectively turned my inbox into a task-oriented dashboard, with all of my actionable email clusters displayed in a single view. The categories are as straightforward as the names suggest.

**Action**: This is shit that I need to get done. Aside from tasks, it often includes messages that require a more involved response than I or my thumbs would care to be involved with through the mobile app.

**Awaiting Reply**: Any email I send that I expect a response from gets moved here as soon as I send it. Pretty standard stuff.

**Delegated**: My least-commonly used label, this is where I track anything that I've trusted someone else to do (and will inevitably need to follow up on at some point).

**References**: This folder has been a life-saver on more than a few occassions. First and foremost, any and all shipping confimations, invoices, flight itineraries, etc. go in here and stay in here until my order has arrived, I'm home from my trip, etc. Other contents include useful articles or tools that I find my self referencing often.

**Procrastinated**: This is the bottomless abyss of procrastination sources... that I've miraculously avoided opening (procrastinated procrastination?). Long articles, links to videos, and all of the other digital minutia that friends send to me (and that I sometime send to myself) gets dumped in here for another day. More often than not, one of my periodic purges will empty the folder, without a single one of the messages being opened. This is a good thing.

And that's the long and short of it. It's a fairly straightforward approach that I've found immensely useful: Mailbox app for sorting, Gmail for execution. When I have to, sorting the mail via Gmail is still fairly quick, and, on day's when I'm away from my computer, Mailbox's only limitation is that I can only view one folder of tasks at a time. Not a big deal, given that I'm on the go anyway. The single folder views on mobile actually make it much easier to quickly glance at whatever I need to when I'm on the go.

A final parting point for all of you wondering how I deal with the remainder of my mail sitting in one giant unsorted archive: when you know how to properly formulate your search terms, navigating through folders by hand is so much slower that maintianing them just isn't worth your time.
