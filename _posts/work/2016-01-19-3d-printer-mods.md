Blah blah blah after some fiddling, these seem to be ideal settings for quality ABS prints:

<pre><code>Layer Height: 0.1mm for detail, 0.2mm for speed
Shell Thickness: 0.8mm (at least 2x nozzle size)
Top/Bottom Thickness: 1.0mm
Fill Density: 40%
Print Speed: 40 - 60mm/sec
Printing Temperature: 245 C
Bed Temperature: 110 C</code></pre>

Now more words here.
