One of my favorite areas of work is data visualization. While scientific and data driven, it provides a tremendous opportunity to integrate artistic design to best communicate the story that the data tells. This is a sampling of the range of visualization styles I've recently worked on. Most are static graphics that I created with some combination of Processing and Inkscape. Recently, I've also been trying to do more work with D3, as it enables richer more interactive experiences. Much of the work shown below has been for my own personal entertainment, but, for the items that I've crafted a story around (or are interactive), I've included links to the project pages.
