As founder & CEO of Jolt, I assembled an interdisciplinary team to develop a consumer hardware product for sports head impact tracking. Following early product development as a solo-founder, I led prototyping and development of embedded sensor hardware product, injection-molded enclosure, custom packaging, backend server, iOS and Android applications, and marketing website.

Additionally, I managed incorporation, budgeting, payroll, finance, fundraising, legal, and intellectual property filings, as well as domestic third-party supply, manufacturing, and fulfillment operations in the Midwest.

Jolt was an [Arch Grants](http://archgrants.org/) winner, completed [MassChallenge](http://masschallenge.org/) and the [Sprint Mobile Health Accelerator](http://sprintaccel.com/) powered by [Techstars](http://www.techstars.com/), and was an [MIT Venture Mentoring Service](http://vms.mit.edu/) company.

Our work garnered extensive press coverage, including features in [Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2741887/The-clip-sensor-prevents-concussion-Tiny-monitor-sends-alerts-referees-player-bangs-head.html), [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2014/09/02/mit-graduates-are-on-a-quest-to-make-sports-related-head-injuries-history-with-better-technology/), [Fast Company](http://www.fastcompany.com/3035730/these-athletic-wearables-will-stop-injuries-before-they-happen), [The Boston Globe](http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/01/23/reebok-others-have-technology-help-prevent-concussions-but-few-sports-adopt/ToxlcL95oQEK6L5zBF9nsN/story.html), [Fox News Health](http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/09/12/former-college-wrestler-aims-to-boost-concussion-prevention-with-clip-on-device.html), and [Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/tech/mit-students-invent-gadget-to-detect-concussions-in-95944765704.html). Additionally, I was recognized on the [Forbes 30 Under 30](http://www.forbes.com/30-under-30-2016/healthcare/#6406b37d297e) list in Healthcare, [Business Insider 100: The Creators](http://www.businessinsider.com/bi-100-the-creators-business-visionaries-creating-value-for-the-world-2016-6), and was a ["Meet the Next Edisons"](http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2016/10/17/these-under-30-summit-panelists-aim-to-be-the-next-edison/#5eb292e26b11) panelist at the Forbes 30 Under 30 Summit.
