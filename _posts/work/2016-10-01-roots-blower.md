My recent move to a new apartment left me without an overhead fan in the bedroom. It wasn't until I found myself without one that I realized just how dependent I've become on the ambient noise to get a good night's sleep. While the simple solution would've been a small plug-in fan or a white noise app on my phone, I'm an engineer, and the easy solutions aren't always the fun ones. As I poked around online looking at more interesting options, I came across Snooz on Kickstarter. Their approach to creating natural full-spectrum white noise was cool, however I'd missed the order window (and have not had good luck with pre-ordered products arriving on-time anyway).

Initially I considered engineering my own version of Snooz, but quickly abandoned that approach in favor of taking a more novel one. As a tinkerer with a growing enthusiasm for all things car-related, I started considering car components that move air and could produce the ambient noise I was looking for. When I came across the roots-type supercharger I knew it was what I wanted. Superchargers are, afterall, often called blowers. Just what I needed. And the unique lobed rotors presented a fun design challenge, as well as an opportunity to try some larger more complex prints on my 3D printer.
