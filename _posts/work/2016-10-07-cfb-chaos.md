Anyone who knows me knows that I'm a huge college football fan. Aside from watching my beloved Penn State Nittany Lions every weekend, I have a four screen setup for watching all of the other big games, pulling for Team Chaos all the way. With respect to college football, chaos is best described as higher ranked teams losing to lower ranked (or unranked teams). Each week, the teams looking to pull of these upsets are collectively the members of Team Chaos.

While there are plenty of good stats out there on teams' records against ranked opponents, I'd never come across data on the specifics of how teams fair against higher or lower ranked opponents. Through the first few weeks of the 2016 season, it was starting to feel like Team Chaos was having a particularly good run, so I set out to pull together data to see if this was indeed the case. I wrote a simple Python script utilizing a headless browser to pull the source code for weekly top 25 game results from ESPN's site, render the pages, scrape the pertinent data, and aggregate it into a workable format.

Using D3.js, I've pulled together a couple of basic visualizations for exploring the data. It's still a work in progress, but I update the data weekly and am working on building a more comprehensive and compelling experience around the stories that this data tells. You can check out the data here (and feel free to recommend improvements that can be made). Note that while the visualizations are responsive, they are not yet fully optimized for small screens and mobile devices.
