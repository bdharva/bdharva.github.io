As product manager for SimpliSafe 3, I led design & development of a third-generation DIY-install home security system comprised of battery-powered sensors communicating with a web-connected base station via a secure custom RF protocol. In addition to my product management responsibilities, I filled additional roles as needed, including development of UX user flows, UI designs and interactive mockups for web and mobile applications, mechanical and industrial design of device enclosures, packaging design, and ideation, design, and prototyping of additional new products.
