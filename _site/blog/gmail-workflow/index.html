            <h2>A Powerful Task-Oriented Gmail Workflow</h2>
            <h4>Jumping on the bandwagon and sharing my Mailbox-compatible solution to email</h4>
            <h5>Friday, January 17, 2014</h5>
            <div class="left ruler"></div>
            <p>I&#8217;ve now seen quite a few interesting posts on Hacker News in the last few months by folks sharing their solutions for dealing with the deluge of emails that many of us trudge through on a daily basis. And I&#8217;ve watched with mild amusement as each has touched on a few points of similarity with my own approach, before veering off the mark. One common issue that I&#8217;ve seen with these various approaches is their use of the Gmail custom star types and priority inbox features that, although useful, are not at all compatible with <a href='http://www.mailboxapp.com/'>Mailbox</a> (and yet they all seem to use it &#8211; a testament to just how kickass Mailbox is for quickly and easily maintaining inbox zero).</p>

<p>Given that Mailbox plays an integral role in how I approach email, it&#8217;s critical that my workflow in Gmail be accomodating of it. And it is. So I just don&#8217;t bother with the stars or priority inbox. I do most of my initial email processing (sorting, deleting, archiving, etc.) via the Mailbox app on my iPhone. For the sake of my productivity, I only check it a few times per day &#8211; after breakfast, after lunch, and when I&#8217;m finishing up my day&#8217;s work sometime in the evening. Through a rigorous and structured approach, I&#8217;m normally back to an empty inbox within a minute or two, despite the volume of email that I have to process.</p>

<p>In this processing phase, I generally only sort the mail, save for the very brief responses. And this is where Mailbox is clutch. With simple side swipes, I can delete or archive inconsequential mail, and delegate the remaining mail to one of my five task-oriented folders: action, awaiting reply, delegated, reference, and procrastinated. At this point, I pivot to my laptop, to work out the remaining process in Gmail. It normally looks something like this:</p>
<img src='/assets/2014-01-17-gmail-workflow/01.png' style='box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px rgb(150,150,150);' />
<p>Using Gmail&#8217;s multiple inbox feature, I&#8217;ve effectively turned my inbox into a task-oriented dashboard, with all of my actionable email clusters displayed in a single view. The categories are as straightforward as the names suggest.</p>

<p><strong>Action</strong>: This is shit that I need to get done. Aside from tasks, it often includes messages that require a more involved response than I or my thumbs would care to be involved with through the mobile app.</p>

<p><strong>Awaiting Reply</strong>: Any email I send that I expect a response from gets moved here as soon as I send it. Pretty standard stuff.</p>

<p><strong>Delegated</strong>: My least-commonly used label, this is where I track anything that I&#8217;ve trusted someone else to do (and will inevitably need to follow up on at some point).</p>

<p><strong>References</strong>: This folder has been a life-saver on more than a few occassions. First and foremost, any and all shipping confimations, invoices, flight itineraries, etc. go in here and stay in here until my order has arrived, I&#8217;m home from my trip, etc. Other contents include useful articles or tools that I find my self referencing often.</p>

<p><strong>Procrastinated</strong>: This is the bottomless abyss of procrastination sources&#8230; that I&#8217;ve miraculously avoided opening (procrastinated procrastination?). Long articles, links to videos, and all of the other digital minutia that friends send to me (and that I sometime send to myself) gets dumped in here for another day. More often than not, one of my periodic purges will empty the folder, without a single one of the messages being opened. This is a good thing.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s the long and short of it. It&#8217;s a fairly straightforward approach that I&#8217;ve found immensely useful: Mailbox app for sorting, Gmail for execution. When I have to, sorting the mail via Gmail is still fairly quick, and, on day&#8217;s when I&#8217;m away from my computer, Mailbox&#8217;s only limitation is that I can only view one folder of tasks at a time. Not a big deal, given that I&#8217;m on the go anyway. The single folder views on mobile actually make it much easier to quickly glance at whatever I need to when I&#8217;m on the go.</p>

<p>A final parting point for all of you wondering how I deal with the remainder of my mail sitting in one giant unsorted archive: when you know how to properly formulate your search terms, navigating through folders by hand is so much slower that maintianing folders isn&#8217;t worth the time.</p>
