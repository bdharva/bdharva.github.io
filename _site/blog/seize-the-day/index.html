            <p>People are creatures of habit. Good, bad, or in between, we become set in our ways — deviating from our habits is difficult. As much as we like to envision ourselves as dynamic adaptive creatures, in many ways we simply are not. Many of our greatest fears in life are rooted in change. Growing up. Moving to a new city. Losing the ones we love. The march of change in the world is constant and undeniable.</p>

<p>It’s fascinating then, that we, as a culture, have developed an annual habit of change. With a new year ahead of us, we throw caution to the wind and, in an act of radical optimism, resolve to seize the opportunity to fundamentally change how we live our lives. It is the ritual of the New Year’s Resolution. Eat better. Exercise more. Read that pile of books that’s been collecting dust. For once, keep up with the dishes. We put tremendous pressure on ourselves to make a laundry list of radical self-improvements to fastidiously adhere to.</p>

<p>But, despite our best intentions, we’re setting ourselves up for failure. We go an entire year (or lifetime) of doing things one way and then convince ourselves that, with the turn of a calendar page, everything will be different. Change is hard, and such a radical upheaval is jarring. If it was easy, we would’ve already done it.</p>

<p>Now, don’t get me wrong. We can change. But not in the ways that we’re attempting to. The most successful approach is one of continuous incremental improvement. Every day (or week, or whatever works for you; the more often, the better), take a few minutes to make a short list. Reflect on how you’ve been living. What’s been going well that you can continue to build upon? And what are your opportunities for improvement? Pick a few most important points of focus and consider simple changes you can begin to make to get yourself moving in the right direction. Make a habit of taking this time for reflection and self-improvement, and savor it. Why wait to do it once a year, when you can do it every day?</p>

<p>These small changes will add up over time. And they will make a greater difference in your life than the face value of the changes themselves. They will help you to live without regret. Instead of missing out on that upcoming 5k with family that you’re not in shape for, start with some jumping jacks tonight before bed, and go from there. Instead of waiting to reach out to a friend you’ve lost contact with until it’s too late, take a few minutes to look them up right now and shoot them a message. Life feels fast now, and it only moves faster. But you can keep up, one small step at a time. Treat every day like that fresh start you’ve been looking for, and you’ll find yourself on the track to a happier and healthier life, free of regrets (and failed resolutions).</p>
