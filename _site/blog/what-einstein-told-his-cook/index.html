            <h2>What Einstein Told His Cook</h2>
            <h4>It's been a while, but I finally read another book</h4>
            <h5>Friday, January 10, 2014</h5>
            <div class="left ruler"></div>
            <p>It&#8217;s safe to say that this is the first time in a very long time that I&#8217;ve read a book of my own free will and accord (mountaineering guides and woodworking references notwithstanding). I can&#8217;t even remember the last real book that I picked to read, but it must&#8217;ve been early in high school before forced academic readings soured my view of literature for leisure.</p>

<p>Recently I&#8217;ve been giving some thought to the concepts that came to shape <a href='/blog/seize-the-day/'>my last post</a> on resolutions, and I became determined to crack the spine on one of my many unread books gathering dust. With my return home for the holidays still a few days off, I turned my attention to my girlfriend&#8217;s bookshelf. Between the knitting guides and cookbooks, &#8220;What Einstein Told His Cook&#8221; was the only title that really grabbed my attention. And for a book that I had little hand in picking, it turned out to be remarkably enjoyable. As one of the only things I hate more than a long-winded and superfluously worded book is a book review of the same ilk, I&#8217;ll cut to the point.</p>

<p>First and foremost, this is not an in-depth scientific book, despite what the title may suggest. Taken literally, the topics covered are far more trivial than what I imagine Einstein would&#8217;ve concerned himself (or his cook) with. I&#8217;ve seen many jump on this as a criticism of the book, however I wholly disagree &#8211; I find it to be its greatest strength. The point of this book is to make cooking, and the science that drives it, interesting and accessible, and, in that regard, the book is spot on. Author Robert Wolke (Washington Post food columnist and former college chemistry professor) dispels common myths about food, pokes fun at silly points of &#8220;common knowledge&#8221;, and doles out helpful nuggets for the aspiring (or struggling) cook, using precisely the right amount of science to help us to understand what the hell is going on in our ovens and on our stovetops.</p>

<p>With his lively prose that is equal parts science and snark, he renders what could be a rather dull topic both fascinating and fun. From the nuances of boiling water to how the cork for our wine bottles is grown, no proverbial stone in the kitchen is left unturned in Wolke&#8217;s thoroughly resourceful quest to uncover (and demonstrate) the truth for the reader, through a mix of home lab (kitchen) experiments, interviews with industry experts, and original recipes (formulated by his wife) to try at home. The explorations strike a delightful balance between the practical kitchen concerns you&#8217;ve always wondered about and quirky lines of inquiry you&#8217;ve never even thought of.</p>

<p>I highly recommend &#8220;What Einstein Told His Cook&#8221; to anyone who&#8217;s ever cooked (or will ever have to), and particularly to young people. For high schoolers struggling to find chemistry interesting, this book could provide the &#8220;real-world&#8221; breakthrough to spark some interest. I imagine it could be spun into some pretty kickass lesson plans for edible labs. And, for young adults like myself, who will invariably come to the conclusion that you can only sustain yourself on beer and Spam for so long, the lessons of this books can ease the the transition to learning to cook for yourself and even doing it well.</p>
