        <p>I've finally done something I've been meaning to for a while and completely overhauled my personal website. It's something I'd fiddled around with for years, constantly changing the structure and design and jumping between content management solutions. As evidenced by the constant changes, something was never quite right about any given iteration. There was always something missing, and, as I progressively became more well-versed in web design, I finally resolved to rebuild from scratch. About the time I completed this process, a friend introduced me to Jekyll. So much for being finished with the constant changes...</p>
        <p>This Jekyll-powered site is what I hope will be a more permanent solution (at least for the forseeable future). Having finally found my "ideal" set-up, I'm also excited to add a blog section to my site, in an effort to condense my content-generation to a single repository. Over the last few years I've been substantially reducing the time that I spend on pursuits that don't yield value on par with my time/effort contribution. I learned that one of my main motivations for my continued, albeit reduced, use of services like Facebook was to share my life adventures with friends and family (who always bothered me for more regular updates when my posts waned). And the rest of the content that I was generating was fractured across a handful of other services.</p>
