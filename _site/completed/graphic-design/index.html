            <h1>Graphic Design</h1>
            <h2>An assortment of recent graphic design work</h2>
            <div class="title ruler"></div>
            <p>Despite my more rational and technical propensities, I&#8217;ve always also had a fairly artistic side. From a young age, I filled all of my school notes with sketches, doodles, and other drawings unrelated to what I should&#8217;ve been taking notes on. In particular, logos always fascinated me, and many of my doodles featured logos of my favorite sports teams or those of teams I dreamt up. When I got to college, I started to learn how to &#8220;digitally sketch&#8221; vector graphics in a free program called Inkscape. I soon took over the duties of making party fliers and rush shirts for my fraternity, and was often responsible for any graphic design and layout associated with group projects for my classes. My architecture coursework gave me the opportunity to begin to fully develop as a designer, with access to more sophisticated tools and professional critique from my instructors. To this day, Inkscape continues to be my favorite program to work with, and I&#8217;ve managed to leverage my proficiency with the program into regular paid design work through my small design company, <a href='http://www.birddoginnovations.com'>Birddog</a>. I also continue to do design work for my fraternity (though I&#8217;m hoping to pass the torch soon, through seminars to share what I&#8217;ve learned with current undergrads) and I&#8217;m always happy to do free work for friends and family in need of design help. Below are samples of some of my recent work, both personal and professional.</p>
