        <h2>Hi, I'm bdharva, and I design things.</h2>
        <h3>Whether it's a completelely new category of (soon-to-be-launched) alcoholic beverage, exceedingly comfortable modern furniture, quirky micro-architecture, or stunning graphic design, I do it all. And with my restless mind and tinkering hands, I'm always learning new things and looking for my next design challenge.</h3>

        <p>Born and raised in central Maryland, I grew up playing sports year round and actively involved in the Boy Scouts of America. Following an early graduation from high school, I enrolled at MIT, where I took a widely interdisciplinary course load, with an emphasis on courses in mechanical engineering and architecture. Continuing my athletic career, I was a national qualifier for the wrestling team in my junior year, and rowed in the heavyweight crew's varsity boat as a senior walk-on.</p>
        <p>Following graduation, I completed a year-long management training program at Anheuser-Busch InBev, and I am now in the process of founding a hardware start-up, in addition to running a small design &amp; marketing company that I also recently founded. Outside of work, I still manage to find time to throw myself headlong into all things active and outdoorsy. I regularly enjoy rock climbing, mountaineering, running, sailing, tennis, and outdoor photography, to name a few.</p>

        <p>I eat, sleep, and breathe design, and you'll find that I'm a quick learner, an inquisitive mind, and a passionate designer. Unfortunately, that means I'm about up to my eyes in design projects for friends, family, and clients, leading me to neglect completion of my own recently re-designed site - please pardon its appearance in the meantime!</p>
