<h1>Archive</h1>
<p>Note: If it hasn't done so already, this is soon going to become an incredibly unwieldy list of random and unrelated posts. I suggest judicious use of Ctrl + F to search out post titles, dates, and tags. Yes, I could've built in search functionality and linked tags and other stuff like that, but that'd take all of the fun of discovery out of your hands. Enjoy!</p>
    {% for post in site.categories.blog %}
    <h2><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a> ({{ post.date | date:"%x" }})</br>{{ post.tags | array_to_sentence_string }}</h2>
    {% endfor %}
