<h1>Archive</h1>
<p>Note: If it hasn't done so already, this is soon going to become an incredibly unwieldy list of random and unrelated posts. Crippled by indecision surrounding how I would like to implement search functionality, I have yet to build it. In the meantime, I suggest judicious use of Ctrl + F to search out post titles, dates, and tags.</p>
    {% for post in site.categories.blog %}
    <h2><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a> ({{ post.date | date:"%x" }})</h2><h3>{{ post.tags | array_to_sentence_string }}</h3>
    {% endfor %}
