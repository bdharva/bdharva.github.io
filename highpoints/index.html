	<p>I have a goal of summiting the highest natural elevation point in all 50 states. While travelling around the country for my rotation-based training program at Anheuser-Busch, I started seeking out local highpoints as a way to get outside and explore the new places I was in. Around the same time, I was lucky enough to be picked for a charity climb of Mt. Whitney (the highest point in the lower 48 states) led by Backpacker Magazine. Between all of the training climbs and that awe-inspiring trip, I was hooked.</p>
